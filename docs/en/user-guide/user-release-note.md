## Release notes

## 01/03/21


Dear Pogues users,

The new version of Pogues in production contains the following enhancements:

- It is now possible to **duplicate a questionnaire** you own via a Duplicate button accessible from the home page listing all your questionnaires;

- the "Collected" boolean, accessible for variables collected within a table, and allowing you to indicate that a table cell will not be collected, is now accessible for variables collected within multiple choice questions;

- the **"End if" of a filter**, recalling the last element composing a filter, is now systematically displayed even when the filter is composed of a single element;

- **The front office has been refactoring** so that the set of questionnaires owned by the user when accessing the Pogues home page is no longer loaded into the store as it is today, but only the metadata of the questionnaires on the home page. The loading of a questionnaire in the store is now done when the user explicitly accesses the questionnaire;

- Matching of scope and IterableReference of loops when the "Based on" field (optional) of a loop is modified.

See you soon,

The Pogues team
