Pogues serves as a front-end application to design questionnaires and represent them in a [formal way](./schema.md). It relies on tiers web services to store and visualize the questionnaires and to connect them with external resources.

For now, Pogues is tightly coupled to the implementation of the services within its original organization (INSEE). In a near future, a more modular and documented approach to integrate Pogues with other providers will be built.
