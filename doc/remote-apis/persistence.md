# Store and retrieve questionnaires

URL and path for this service are configured in [config](../src/js/config.js), with `baseURL` and `poguesPath` entries. For now, representation of questionnaires within this web service is slightly different from the formal description provided by [pogues model](). This representation is closer from the inner requirements of Pogues but can easily translate to and from the formal representation. In a near future, questionnaires should be persisted in the same way they are
